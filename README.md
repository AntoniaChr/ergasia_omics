I have uploaded 7 files for my assignment.
For the first part of the project (run the scRNA-seq tutorial from Seurat) I uploaded a file with all the code in R and a pdf with all the plots I produce and the explanation for each of them.  
For the second part of the project (Reproduce a figure from a published paper), I uploaded a jubyter file with my code in python along with my report and the correspontive plots. Also, I add the 4 plots in an image format in case there are any troubles with the jubyter.
